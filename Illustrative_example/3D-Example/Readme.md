## Results 1

Correlation conditioning (“Corr”) consistently outperforms “MinMax.” In the figure, Corr reaches the exact-likelihood line around nn_size ≈ 50, whereas MinMax needs roughly nn_size ≈ 90 to achieve a comparable value.

## Results 2

The hyperparameter distance to the baseline shows the same trend: for a given neighbor size, Corr produces smaller L2 discrepancies, particularly at smaller nn_size.

## Results 3

The prediction discrepancy (full model vs. approximation) shrinks as nn_size increases; by about nn_size ≈ 50 it becomes negligible in practice.
