In this repository, we introduce a novel multi-fidelity gaussian process model that
perform data fusion of spatio-temporal dataset by means of vecchia approximation.
Thanks to our novel framework, we are able to separate the low-fidelity Gaussian pro-
cess from the discrepancy process, applying the vecchia approximation independently
to each of them. Surprisingly, our model also allows for non-stationary integration of
different fidelity levels, aspect that resulted very challenging when dealing with the
non-approximated model, due to to inherent dense matrix involved in not approxi-
mate computation.

The projects is still underdevelopment.
